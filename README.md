# ECMA Script Rocks
Standard Javascript Encyclopedia

A collective contribution to knowledge pool of Javascript community with a zeal to learn from the community and contribute back to the community enlightening with the power of Javascript. 

## Motivation Factor:
Growth of Javascript from just being a **client side** optional language with power to disable in the browser on demand, to server side language competing with industrial grade backend frameworks took me by a surprise. Despite being non-structured, no strict types defined, Javascript grew to be proven as one of the powerful language that can drive anything from simple browser interactions to Robots that can automate human jobs is like **(oooooooH WOOOOOW)**

## Catalyst resposible for the growth

- Google - Chome, V8 *etc..*
- Node.js
- Stackoverflow 
- Mozilla - Firefox, Asm.js *etc..*
- All amazing Javascript frameworks that requires a standing ovation **(Huge shout out to you all)**
- Ofcourse the community of developers, JS lovers and FOSS supporters, like me ;)

## Join this Knowlege base

I would like to see the developers across the universe to come and collectively contribute to this initiative. Lets join hands and take Javascript to **Mars and eventually to other galaxies**
